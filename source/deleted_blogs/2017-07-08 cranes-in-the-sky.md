 *Cranes in the Sky.* July 2017. Watercolour & ink. 

One of my favourite songs of the past year is Solange's standout track ["Cranes in the Sky"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0qrinhNnOM) from her album *A Seat at the Table*, the meaning of which Solange explained in her Interview Magazine [cover story](http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/solange/#_). 

<cite> "I used to write and record a lot in Miami during that time, when there was a real estate boom in America, and developers were developing all of this new property. There was a new condo going up every ten feet... I remember looking up and seeing all of these cranes in the sky. They were so heavy and such an eyesore, and not what I identified with peace and refuge. I remember thinking of it as an analogy... this idea of building up, up, up that was going on in our country at the time, all of this excessive building, and not really dealing with what was in front of us. And we all know how that ended. That crashed and burned. It was a catastrophe. And that line came to me because it felt so indicative of what was going on in my life as well. And, eight years later, it's really interesting that now, here we are again, not seeing what's happening in our country, not wanting to put into perspective all of these ugly things that are staring us in the face. </cite>

When I first heard "Cranes in the Sky", I thought Solange was referring to cranes of an opposite symbolism. Cranes are the metal construction machines that dot our cityscapes. But cranes are also the species of large birds that represent hope and healing during challenging times. The latter is what we should be building instead.
