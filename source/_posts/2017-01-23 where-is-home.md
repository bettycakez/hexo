Since graduating from McGill a year ago, I’ve become an “expat” and have found it harder and harder to define home. I’ve moved from Montreal to Geneva to New York for my career, chasing after the next opportunity, the next challenge, the next adventure. In contrast, many of my close friends have secured stable, long-term, lucrative jobs and are now investing in real estate, non-IKEA furniture, and a friend circle of “regulars”. And I’ve started to wonder, have I been approaching it all wrong? Instead of going where the tide takes me, **should I actively be looking to plant down roots in a place I can call home?** 

**No**, I have concluded. The non-permanence and uncertainty of being labeled an “expat” has had its downsides including many visa headaches, excessive airline baggage fees, and the stress of relocating. But my expatriate title has also afforded me the chance to accomplish career milestones and catch once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that I wouldn’t have been able to do anywhere else. In Geneva, I sat in on DG Dr. Margaret Chan’s opening remarks during the 69th World Health Assembly and publishing my first paper in the Oxford Journals alongside prominent names in global health. In New York, I feel privileged to call the United Nations Headquarters my office, and fighting for gender equality my work. Along the way , I have met diverse, incredible people from every nook and cranny of the continents who have opened my eyes to how much I have yet to learn. And although saying “goodbye” to these peers, friends, and mentors have been hard, I have learned to say “see you later”. 

Maybe one day, when I have cause to pause and stand still in one place, I will. But for now, I wear my “expat” title with pride, and countless stamps in my passport as cherished souvenirs. **And I look forward, embracing the unexpected turns and certain uncertainty to come!**
