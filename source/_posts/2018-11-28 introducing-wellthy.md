***My outlook on consumer health***

Stress and anxiety. Our zip code. The number of hours we spend exercising in a week. These are a few predictors of our health that are often overlooked in our traditional healthcare system. In fact, social determinants of health contribute to [50%]( https://www.healthmgttech.com/are-you-considering-the-other-50-of-your-patient%E2%80%99s-health) of our health outcomes; yet, the focus has still been on bandaid treatments and prescriptions in America’s fee-for-service model. 

This is the biggest opportunity I see in consumer health – to create products, services, and opportunities for everyone to live healthy and live well. Equitably. Everyday.  

One potential health systems innovation I’ve had the privilege of exploring, developing and piloting in my work at the United Nations and Sidewalk Labs has been “social prescribing”. A model adopted in the UK by the NHS, [social prescribing](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/06/nhs-should-expand-social-prescribing-says-health-secretary) links patients in primary care with sources of support and activities, e.g. fitness classes, volunteering, within the community to improve their health and wellbeing by addressing social determinants of health.  

***Introducing Wellthy***

Wellthy’s mission was inspired by the potential of the social prescribing model to be translated into the American context. Wellthy is what social prescribing could look like if democratized directly to consumers, leapfrogging over our politically uncertain, bureaucratic medical care system.

Wellthy also builds on three trends I observe in the current tech market: 

1.	With the advents of AI making personalization the norm (Netflix & Spotify), ML-powered algorithms have also improved social search and networking. Ironically, the networks that are supposed to connect us have been shown to affect our mental health and divide us. [A study](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why) in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine found that among young adults, heavy use of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter were associated with feelings of social isolation. These platforms have also been accused of fanning propaganda and inciting violence globally. This is an opportunity to redefine what being social means. It is not just about the likes, comments, and other “content engagement” metrics we have been conditioned to crave, but what meaningful connections between people can look like: breaking out from our siloes, facilitating learning amongst one another, healthy debates and dialogue, and for us to come together in the physical and digital spaces we inhabit. **This is the time for a new social network that uncompromisingly puts individuals and society first.**

2.	Making plans to attend events is hard, and one of the biggest barriers to us going out. There have been existing apps that have tried to tackle what social meetups could look like, especially amongst the dating use case (Tinder, Bumble). But it takes a lot of coordinating through multiple apps. Example: Let me meet a prospective date on Hinge, message them on Facebook, and make a reservation at a café on Yelp. Beyond the time, the effort and anxiety of coordinating social outings is one of the biggest reasons people are funneled out of meetup apps. For siloes in our societies to be broken, our digital ecosystem including mobile payments should be seamlessly integrated into one user-centred mobile platform. **We are the digitally native and deserve an effortless end-to-end mobile experience.**

3.	Lastly, food is inherently social and the restaurant market is huge and growing – almost [$800B]( https://www.restaurant.org/Downloads/PDFs/News-Research/2017_Restaurant_outlook_summary-FINAL.pdf) nationally and [$43.3B]( https://www.restaurant.org/Downloads/PDFs/State-Statistics/NewYork.pdf) in New York. Yet [57%]( https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-eat-most-of-their-meals-alone-2014-08-18) of meals are eaten alone. In an oversaturated, competitive market, small indie businesses are the ones on the chopping block struggling to fill empty tables; [80%](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-restaurants-fail-rate-2011-8) of NY restaurants close in the first five years. We can facilitate interaction not just between people, but people and restaurants. It's a win-win-win for all three parties involved: restaurants collect additional revenue and increase operational efficiency through our tech innovation, users get access to a meaningful network and quality meals at a discounted price; and we generate revenue streams from restaurants (and potentially users) by facilitating this transaction. **With restaurants as our valued partners, we can test and scale a sustainable business model where there are only winners at the table.**

It is with these personal motivations and passions that I ideated Wellthy, an end-to-end mobile platform that connects people and restaurants to meet and eat well together.
