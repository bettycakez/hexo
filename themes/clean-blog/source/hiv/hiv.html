    <div id="video-subtitle">
      In Mozambique, 11.5% of the population is living with HIV. In 2016 alone, there were 62,000 AIDS-related deaths. How did
      this coastal African country come to have one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world? And what does it take to
      end the HIV pandemic?

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I met Fatima last summer on the dusty backroads of Quelimane, a small seaport in Mozambique. At a glance, she reminded me
      of my own sister back home - 16 years young, wide eyes, and a sharp curiosity on display as she rattled off a stream
      of questions. But Fatima told a startlingly different story from any teenager I had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I started working on the streets when I was 13, to make money for my family. I couldn’t go to school anymore,” she confided.
      “Last year, I got tested and they told me I had HIV. My friends won’t talk to me anymore.”
    </p>

      In 2015, the United Nations set ambitious targets to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic globally by 2030, entrenched in the
      <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg3">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>. HIV or human immunodeficiency virus infects cells of the immune system, destroying
      or impairing their function and resulting in progressive deterioration of the immune system. HIV can be transmitted
      through unprotected sexual intercourse; transfusion of contaminated blood; the sharing of contaminated needles or other
      sharp instruments; and from mother-to-infant during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. When diagnosed, HIV-positive
      patients undergo antiretroviral therapy (ART) to slow the progression of HIV. At its late, most serious stage, HIV
      causes AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, leading to death over time. Where more than
      <a href=http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/>35 million people</a> have died from HIV globally, there is still no working vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS. In Mozambique,
      the country with the 8th highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS, there were still
      <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/mozambique">1,800,000 people (11.5% of the population)</a>
      living with HIV in 2016, among whom only half were accessing ART.
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers, including those at
      <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conceptual-framework-of-the-HIV-transmission-agent-based-model-Arrow-represents-causal_fig1_231743246">Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health</a>, have mapped the transmission of the virus through a systems framework
      to understand the causes and effects of HIV/AIDS. But as Fatima's story illustrates, HIV/AIDS is a complex disease,
      interlinking with factors like education, poverty, and access to quality health services. To prioritize and implement
      promising interventions and eradicate HIV/AIDS in Mozambique and globally, it takes seeing the big picture.

    <h1>System</h1>
    <p>
      Systems thinking allows us to break down the interacting, interrelated, and interdependent parts of the circular world we
      live in, to identify the structures that drive patterned behaviour and events. By understanding and changing structures
      that are not serving us well, we can get to holistic, long-term solutions to chronic problems. Finding solutions to
      end HIV/AIDS are no different. Below, I explore the general topics (nodes) and relationships (edges) that can affect
      the prevalence of HIV and AIDS.

    <h1>Solutions</h1>
    <p>
      Many topics contribute to and stem from the prevalence of HIV and AIDS, with clusters related to government; the economy;
      healthcare; medical R&D; water, sanitation, and hygiene; agriculture; societal norms; and infrastructure. These structures
      and patterns can be seen in Mozambique’s existing policy and program efforts to eradicate HIV/AIDS. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mozambique has approximately three physicians for every 100,000 people, and shortages of other health providers, such
        as nurses, pharmacists, and lab technicians, in part due to poor literacy rates. In 2007, the Ministry of Health
        began training non-physician clinicians known as técnicos de medicina in HIV/AIDS care through a nationwide training
        and clinical mentoring program, a strategy known as
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2994547/">‘task shifting’</a>.</li>
      <li>Public service financing in Mozambique is detrimental to the scaling of HIV/AIDS programs. HIV/AIDS care accounts for
        almost half of the Ministry of Health’s budget of
        <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/field-news/mozambique-long-fight-against-hivaids-uncertain-outcome">$138.7 million</a>, yet foreign aid is also needed. In early 2018, the Global Fund, an international financing organization,
        approved
        <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-kim/north-korean-u-s-officials-air-differences-on-eve-of-summit-trump-stays-positive-idUSKBN1J609X">$515 million</a>
        in new grants for Mozambique to fight AIDS, as well as co-infections, tuberculosis and malaria. Financing will be allocated
        based on Mozambique’s 2015–2019 national strategic HIV/AIDS plan.
      </li>
      <li>In rural areas in Mozambique where
        <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201705100560.html">11% of the population</a> is living with HIV, there is a lack of access to health facilities and other social services
        like quality education. Beyond financial costs, time-associated costs become prohibitive, with round trips to health
        care facilities taking more than
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4356279/">24 hours</a> in areas without transportation and road infrastructure.
        <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/92/9/13-129478/en/">Mobile health clinics</a>
        marketed in partnership with community influencers in rural parts allows for the expansion of HIV testing and counselling,
        and ART services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Beyond existing HIV strategies and priorities which heavily focus on healthcare interventions, novel solutions targeted towards overlooked, marginalized populations can
      also be investigated within the system - ensuring that no one gets left behind. In Mozambique, one of the largest vulnerable
      groups are girls and young women like Fatima. They are
      <a href="http://www.unicef.org.mz/en/our-work/the-children/young-people/">three times</a> more likely to be HIV-positive than boys and young men, and to get infected at an earlier age. Hearing
      directly from Fatima on her plight, her concerns, her wants and needs, gave a glimpse into the complexities that women
      and girls with HIV face. Using three topics Fatima alluded to in our conversation - sex work, stigma against HIV and
      sexual health, and economic security - I explore potential interventions within the causal loop diagrams below:

          1. The case for banning child prostitution
        </i>
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>Fatima is one of
      <a href=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/mozambique>13,553 sex workers</a> living with HIV in Mozambique, a country where prostitution is prevalent - and legal. Sex workers
      are at high risk of early pregnancy and contracting HIV, and of being forced into human trafficking. These sex workers
      are often girls and young women. A
      <a href=http://www.gvnet.com/childprostitution/Mozambique.htm>2001 study</a> showed that 98% of child prostitutes were girls, 26% were aged 10-14 years, and only 14.1% attended
      school. A possible solution: the Mozambique government should ban child prostitution, giving girls like Fatima a chance
      at a healthy childhood free of communicable diseases, access to quality education, and the skills to be employed and
      empowered economically. Economic security and independence gives these girls a path out from poverty and the sex industry.

          2. Community influencers reduce HIV and sexual health stigma
        </i>
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>Arguably, the biggest barrier towards progress in eliminating HIV/AIDS is the societal stigma surrounding sex, sexuality,
      and sexual and reproductive health. For example, those who are HIV-positive often fear others knowing of their status,
      as like Fatima they can be shunned and gossiped about. In Mozambique, government and development actors should work
      with religious leaders (
      <a href=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/religious-beliefs-in-mozambique.html>81.3% of the population</a> identifies with a religion) and teachers to implement sexual education curricula in schools
      and churches. This facilitates open discussion by trusted community influencers on topics including HIV, increasing
      health-seeking behaviour like family planning and delivery of factual info so people can make informed, science-based
      decisions.

          3. Women's economic inclusion in the agriculture sector
        </i>
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>Mozambique is still predominantly a patriarchal society, where women participate
      <a href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/gender/country/mozambique">less</a> in the labour force than men, especially in mid- and high-income jobs. The agriculture sector supports about
      <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---africa/---ro-addis_ababa/---ilo-lusaka/documents/publication/wcms_499746.pdf">80%</a> of the economically active population and
      <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---africa/---ro-addis_ababa/---ilo-lusaka/documents/publication/wcms_499746.pdf">87%</a> of the female labour force in the country. Women’s economic participation in sustainable agriculture increases
      crop yields, and contributes to food security where more than
      <a href="https://www.gainhealth.org/knowledge-centre/3-things-learned-time-mozambique/">2 million or 43% of children under 5</a> are affected by chronic malnutrition. Nutrition and healthy diets are important
      for Fatima and other HIV-positive women and men in maintaining strength, energy, and a healthy immune system to prolong
      the latency of the virus.
